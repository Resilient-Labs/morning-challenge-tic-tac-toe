playArea = Array.from(playArea)//this turns the node list of  the 'play area' classes into an actual array to be manipulated



//this for each loop goes into each box and adds an eventlistener for when each box is clicked. upon the click event , if a box already contains an 'X' or an 'O' no other actions will be preformed on click of the box.  The player variable which contains 'x' is set as the inner text of the box upon click and the ternary operator alternates between 'x' and 'o' depending  on which was clicked last. The whoWon method of the gameLogic object has been called within this foreach loop to check for our win conditions
playArea.forEach(box => {

  box.addEventListener('click', () => {
    if(box.innerText != '') {
      return

// this class was created to host the whoWon() method. orginally there was also a method for checking draw games but it was creating a bug in which if the last person won when all of the boxes were full it would still consider it a draw. to remedy this I removed the method entirely and added the draw functionality to the 'else' of the whoWon() method.
