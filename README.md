## Design and Development
**Skills Used** HTML, CSS, Object Oriented Javascript:
This game is built first by documenting pseudo code. I consider what this game intends to to (i.e., presenting and image in each square, keeping scores, taking turns, resetting, alerting a winner). This helps me build the functions to achieve this game. As for the breakfast theme, I just really enjoy bacon and eggs. Their shapes are also fitting for this project.

## Lessons Learned
This project was good and fun practice for learning object oriented programming.
