# ðŸ“Š Morning Challenge: Tic-Tac-Toe

### Goal: Create a two player Tic-Tac-Toe game. The users should be able to click to place their X or O and if they win the program should mention their win in the DOM. Please make the game as OOP as possible.

Let's play a game! This project consisted of a two player basic tic tac toe game. Be X or O and see who is the first to win! If no winner, there will be a 'Draw!'

<b>Tech Used:</b> HTML5, CSS3 and Javascript

Lessons Learned: Creating classes using OOP challenged my thinking in terms of how I created projects using JavaScript in the past. I also learned that collaboration while doing this project was very helpful. It was exciting to see how impactful using classes with properties and methods can be when trying to create what seemed like a "simple game". I will never cease to be amazed by what incredible things I can create using JavaScript.
