# ðŸŽ° Week07 Bootcamp2021 Project: Tic-Tac-Toe Game

### Goal: Build a Simple Tic-Tac-Toe Game

This is my simple tic-tac-toe game project! The game will be played by two players sharing the screen. X will always go first and the game does not start until X goes. Players must match 3 tiles in order to win.

I added additional styling to the fonts and images.


### Lessons Learned:

This project was my first introduction to Object Oriented Programming, it helped me become familiar with creating and using object properties and methods. In addition, I had a lot of practice with arrays and using the for each method as well.
