## Project Description

Alien Tic Tac Toe is a two-player game that brings a fun twist to the classic tic-tac-toe experience. With an alien theme, users can enjoy battling each other in a game of wits. The primary objective of this project is to implement a two-player tic-tac-toe game using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. Users can play the game, make moves, and reset the board for a rematch.

## How It's Made üõ†Ô∏è

- **Technologies Used:** HTML, CSS, Vanilla OOP JavaScript
- **Project Organization:**
  - Organized project into folders: assets (for images, fonts, etc.), css (for styles), js (for JavaScript files), and the root folder containing README and index.html.
- **Styling:**
  - Implemented a gamer-themed font called "Press Start 2P" to enhance the alien gaming experience.
  - Utilized a keyframe shake animation for player pieces, creating a dynamic effect when users hover over them.

## Optimizations üöÄ

- **Code Refactoring:**
  - Refactored the code to enhance reusability.
  - Structured the game logic into different steps, consolidating methods within the `runGame()` method for improved organization.

## Lessons Learned üß†

- **Object-Oriented Programming:**
  - Gained a deeper understanding of OOP principles through the development process.
- **Challenges:**
  - Overcame challenges, particularly in the process of checking for a winner.
  - Implemented a solution using a nested array to efficiently check for winning combinations.
