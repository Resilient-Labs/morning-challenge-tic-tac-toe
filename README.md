How It's Made:
Tech Stack: HTML, CSS, Javascript
I used OOP to create this project. I started by declaring a class. Once I assigned parameters to the constructor keyword, I used the keyword this to declare those properties to the object. I also declared a function makeMOve, which allows the player to make a move every time one of the boxes is clicked.  I set up a count of the clicks performed on the grid so that the system could calculate when to display "Draw!". A non-constant win status variable was also declared in order to caluclate, then notify, when a player had won. 

Optimizations:
At first, my project did not use much OOP(Object-Oriented Programming), so I went back and made sure to do so. 

Lessons Learned: 
I learned about set theory and started learning about how a set differentiates from an array.
