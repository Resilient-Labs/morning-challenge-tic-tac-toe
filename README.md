# ðŸ“Š Morning Challenge: Tic-Tac-Toe

### Goal: Create a two player Tic-Tac-Toe game. The users should be able to click to place their X or O and if they win the program should mention their win in the DOM. Please make the game as OOP as possible.

I completed the challenge: 4
I feel good about my code: 5
I know that my code isn't perfect and I have questions about a couple things. Despite that, I worked really hard to understand OOP and worked with a lot of people and a few mentors in order to really comprehend how to take code that is mostly function based and make it OOP. I put a 4 for challenge completion because I haven't gotten my win message to specify which player won. I got stuck in a recursive loop according to google (I got htis error in my console and googled it: Uncaught RangeError: Maximum call stack size exceeded) and I'm not really sure how. Google did mention repetitive code and mine was certainly repetitive in that section, but I'm not sure how to fix it and it's 5:35 AM so I'm gonna fix it tomorrow with an EIR.
Example:
