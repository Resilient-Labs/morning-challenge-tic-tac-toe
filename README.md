## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS and JavaScript

Applied all the JavaScript knowledge we've learned so far. I used a for forEach loop to add event listener to all the cells, and practised creating arrow functions. 

## Lessons Learned:

I would definitely want to come back to this project and add OOP.
