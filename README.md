# ❌ TIC TAC TOE ⭕

This project reinforces my understanding on the core concepts of OOP and Javascript ES6 features and their applications. I wanted to keep my code as compact as possible. I wanted to do a Neon theme for this project! The product came out clean, eye catching and fun! By the end of it. I'm excited for the future projects, so stay tuned!

# What I Learned

### Javascript Classes
Classes are templates/blueprints for JS objects created with the class keyword. The name of the class is written using Pascal case instead of the usual Camel case. 

### Constructor
Constructors are special methods defined in JS classes to create and initialize objects of the the class. They contain a list of parameters with properties for the objects. The this keyword is used to define an object passed through the constructor 

### Instantiate
To instantiate an object is to create a new object to be passed though the class created with. These objects can be declared by a variable and use the new keyword to create the instance of a user-defined object type.

### Methods
Some Method checks whether at least one element in the array passes the test implemented by the provided function. Return Boolean

Every Method checks whether all the elements pass the test implemented by the provided testing function. Returns Boolean
method checks whether an array includes a certain value. Returns Boolean.
