# Tic Tac Toe

Users are able to paly with the computer against a game of tic tac toe. One player will put in eels, one will put in escalators. First person to reach three in a row will win.

## How It's Made:

Languages/frameworks use: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

## Thoughts:

This one was a bit tough to get working. It was somewhat similar to the to-do list where it things were registered on click, and similar to the slot machine where you had to make all three equal to each other in order for it to count as a win. It was mostly trying to figure out how to make this happen on a bigger scale (with 9 slots instead of just 3). 

Shoutout Gabby for the amazing CSS.
