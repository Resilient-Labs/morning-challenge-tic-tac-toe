# Tic-Tac-Toe Game

Game of Thrones themed Tic-Tac-Toe game: Create a two player Tic-Tac-Toe game. The users should be able to click to place their X or O and if they win the program should mention their win in the DOM. Please make the game as OOP as possible.

## How it's Made:
Tech Used: Javascript, CSS & HTML

## Lessons Learned:
This project was my first attempt at implementing Object Oriented Programming in my Javascript. While I understand the overall concepts and syntax, I find myself having difficultly fully transforming my code to fit the OOP methodology. I look forward to coming back to this project and rewriting it once I have a better understanding of OOP.
