## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

We built this using Object Oriented Programming. The gameboard was an object that had the properties and methods of players, winning conditions, and marks.

## Lessons Learned:

I learned more about how Event Listeners interact with objects and different ways of manipulating objects so that they're reusable.
