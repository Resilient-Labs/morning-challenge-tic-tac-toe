## How It's Made:
Tech used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

This Tic-Tac-Toe is primarily a Javascript exercise. This is my first project experimenting with object oriented programming (OOP). I started by coding using procedural programming and then looking for patterns in my code to attempt to make it more object oriented. It was no easy task, but I'm glad I had the opportunity to flex my OOP muscles for the first time and give it a try.



## Lessons Learned:
It was very confusing trying to figure out how the different methods in a class interact and communicate with each other without getting tangled up. Getting comfortable with the _this_ keyword and how to access and call different methods all while understanding what is happening was also quite a challenge. Although I stumbled quite a bit in this project, I am excited to keep trying because I know there is so much power in OOP.
