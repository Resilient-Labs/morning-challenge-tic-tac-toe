The object of the challenge was to create a tic-tac-toe game for 2 users. They would be able to click on the space, and either 'x' or 'o' will appear. And if there is a winner, a message letting them know will appear. I also added a "its a draw" message if neither players win. A class was created for the game, along with two methods. One method to check the winner, and the other is to check if there was a draw. Two buttones were put in place, when user clicks for x or o, and when user clicks on the restart button. Which a restart method was also added for users to begin another round of the game.
