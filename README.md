## How It's Made:
Tech used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

The app utilizes javascript to place the x and o string on different "spaces" on the board. The game also logs winners and keeps score of each win. This project was created bject oriented.

## Lessons Learned:

This project caused lots of confusion. Objects are a bit tricky for me at the moment still but am going to try and touch up on them a bit each chance I get.
