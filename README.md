## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML5, CSS, JavaScript

Retro-Time Tic Tac Toe was another great project where we were able to apply some JavaScript concepts and practice Object Oriented Programming by using classes and ojects. 

<!-- ## Optimizations

An array could be used as we learned more about those and objects. Will be looking to add and optimize this code in the future. -->

## Reflections:

I really enjoyed the CSS aspect of this project - it was fun to design. I enjoyed working in team, brainstorming different ideas, and working together to understand OOP principles.
