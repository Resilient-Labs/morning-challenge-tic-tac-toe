## How It's Made

The appplication mainly focuses on using OOP to execute the code. Using four methods, the computer first checks if the player's move is a valid move, once it verifies the move to be valid the player's turn is recorded, then the computer checks for a win, and resets the board once the reset button is hit.

## What I Learned
Because a game of Tic-Tac-Toe relies on repetitive actions, using OOP for this program was a really efficient way to execute it. After the application was finished, I realized how much shorter and cleaner my code was after implementing OOP compared to my previous code (using only HTML, CSS, and everything stored in a main JS). Overall, I learned a lot of OOP basics and am confident about my understanding of it.
