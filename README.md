## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript (OOP)

I learned how to create Tic Tac Toe using nested arrays. When people click on the grid, it'll compute the row and column they are in. Using bracket notation, it goes through a for loop to check for winning conditions in the rows and columns.

# Lessons Learned

* How to easily detect which row/column a player clicks on using simple math equations
* Using event.target.id for click events on the grid
* Checking win conditions using for loops and conditional statements
* Creating a grid with CSS
* Switching between players with a simple function
* Converting a game to OOP
