# Tic Tac Toe

Does looking at this game bring back nostalgic memories? It sure does for me! This is a simple tic tac toe game where two players are able to click on each square until a winning combo appears. Afterwards, the players are able to reset/play the game again.

## Languages Used 

This was created using HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript. 

## Lessons Learned 

The biggest challenge we faced as a team was creating a function to stop the game if there was a tie or if someone wins. Initially, our game would allow the players to continue clicking on each square even if there was already a winning combination present. Another challenging aspect of this project was figuring out how to have the pictures appear and alternate depending on which player's turn it was. Despite all of the challenges, I really enjoyed creating one of my favorite childhood games.
