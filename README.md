## How It's Made:
Tech used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript




## Lessons Learned:

I learned a couple of things while building this project, it was definitely more difficult than I thought as this was my first time using classes in JS in a practical manner. I learned that classes can have constructors that don't need to take in any parameters or create properites if they are not needed. I learned about the every() method for arrays and how to turn elements into a nodeList and then into an array. I learned a little more about how to psuedo code my code and break down the logic of a task such as tic tac toe. I gained a better understanding of loops, specifically forEach and how it can be used to loop through arrays. I also learned how to use arrow functions propery in order to reduce the lines of code I create.
