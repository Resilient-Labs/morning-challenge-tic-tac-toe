# ðŸ“Š Morning Challenge: Tic-Tac-Toe

### Goal: Create a two player Tic-Tac-Toe game. The users should be able to click to place their X or O and if they win the program should mention their win in the DOM. Please make the game as OOP as possible.

### How to submit your code for review:

- Fork and clone this repo
- Create a new branch called answer
- Checkout answer branch
- Push to your fork
- Issue a pull request
- Your pull request description should contain the following:
  - (1 to 5 no 3) I completed the challenge
  - (1 to 5 no 3) I feel good about my code
  - Anything specific on which you want feedback!

Example:
```
The project partial complete. I need to fix the win conditions and the X's O's. I'm going to send an improve version later today.
I'm getting used to constructors a bit. It was confusing earlier due to jumping straight to class instead of working my way up through constructor instead.
After I get the code and project done, I'll go through and clean it up a bit.
```
