# Tic x Tac x Toe

### Goal: Create a two player Tic-Tac-Toe game. The users should be able to click to place their X or O and if they win the program should mention their win in the DOM. Please make the game as OOP as possible.

In this project I created a two player Tic-Tac-Toe game using JavaScript Object Oriented Programming. The users are able to click to place their X or O and if they win the program declares their win in the DOM. I decided to take a spin on it and actually the design inspired by one of my favorite Anime, Hunter x Hunter.



## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, OOP

This was the first time using OOP in JavaScript. I used a simple CSS design, where originally I wanted to use Gon & Killua's faces as the "X" and "O", but I could not figure it out quite yet! I enjoyed putting OOP into practice, and hope I can do so more as well. 

## Lessons Learned:

I want to continue  to practice using JavaScript OOP in my future projects. I think technically this project is not fully OOP, but hopefully I can make some edits to do so.
